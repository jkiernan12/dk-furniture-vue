    <p>David Kiernan has been making contemporary furniture in his Rhode Island studio since 1993. David, a former engineer, studied woodworking at the Worcester Center for Crafts.</p>
    <p>"I find it exhilarating to use materials such as unique veneers, unusual stone, or patinated metals. Envisioning how to use these materials, provokes excitement and eagerness to proceed with a project. This to me is the essence of being a furniture maker; the process of discovery followed by transformation into a tangible, beautiful object."</p>
